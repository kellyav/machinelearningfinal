Beginers Guide to posting code on Github:

You can do this one of two ways. Manually on the website or through a push request using Terminal (Command line code). 
For our purposes we can use the manual way.
See: https://github.com/kellyav/isat_2020/blob/master/pull_request.md for my Commandline How-to guide. 

0. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

To update our R markdown file: 
0. note that you can edit the code directly on Githubs website but i doubt we will actually do that so here is how to update the repository with changes to the Rmarkdown file:

1. Download this repository so that there is a copy on your computer. To do this, click "clone or download"

2. Click "download zip" This will not actually download as a zip file, but now the folder will be saved on your computer. Edit the R markdown file like you normally would and save that same file so that it is changed within the folder. 

3. 



To add a completely new file: 
1. Under your repository name, click Upload files.

2. Drag and drop the file or folder you'd like to upload to your repository onto the file tree.

3. At the bottom of the page, type a commit message that explains the change you made to the R markdown file. 

The commit will post with your name on it, saying that you made changes and when the last changes were made. 
*! Important!* For us, since we are working with three people and the project will consist of a lot of moving parts, 
choose the "Create new branch" option when posting the code. That way we can create a version history and it doesnt replace older version of the code, just in case something goes wrong like an error, and we can go back and look at previous versions.
Name the branch by version number and keep the naming consistent. 

4. Click Commit change/ propose file change.

5. This prompts the page to Open a Pull Request. You can leave further comments here if you want to. 

6. Then click Merge Pull Request.  

7. Click Confirm merge and voila!
