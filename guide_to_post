Beginers Guide to posting code on Github:

You can do this one of two ways. Manually on the website or through a push request using Terminal (Command line code). 
For our purposes we can use the manual way.
See: for the Command line How-to. 

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

2. Under your repository name, click Upload files.

3. Drag and drop the file or folder you'd like to upload to your repository onto the file tree.

4. At the bottom of the page, type a commit message that explains the change you made to the R markdown file. 

The commit will post with your name on it, saying that you made changes and when the last changes were made. 
! Important! For us, since we are working with three people and the project will consist of a lot of moving parts, 
choose the "Create new branch" option when posting the code. That way we can create a version history and it doesnt replace older version of the code, just in case something goes wrong like an error, and we can go back and look at previous versions.

5. Click Commit changes.
