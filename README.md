Final project progress will be posted on this repo. 

We will be working on the dataset *Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)*,  updated 4 years ago (Version 2) and posted on Kaggle: 
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

It can also be found on UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

## Motivation/Description
We will use Rmarkdown to determine the type of tumor a breast cancer patient has, malignant (M) or benign (B) by using data procured from biopsy samples of Wisconsin cancer patients in the early 1990s. Our project will also compare the results from K-NN and Naive Bayes to determine which machine learning algorithm is the best for predicting the type of cancer in a small dataset. It will also examine how variable selection affects the error rate for K-NN and Naive Bayes.

## Description of the ML Algorithm
Data exploration and a Chi-square test will be used to determine which variables are predictors for the type of tumor the breast cancer patient has. K-NN and Naive Bayes will be run using all the predictor variables in the dataset. These same algorithms will also run with only the variables that are significant predictors of the type of cancer. The results will be compared to determine if there is a difference between the error rate of using all the variables and the error rate of using only the significant predictors. The error rates will also be examined to determine whether K-NN or Naive Bayes works best at predicting the type of tumor the breast cancer patient has.
